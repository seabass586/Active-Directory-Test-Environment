To begin, download the virual machine of your choice. I am going to be using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

### Download the Windows Server ISO
You're going to need an ISO (disk image) of a version of Windows Server. In this guide I am going to be using Windows Server 2025. You can get a trial version on the [Microsoft evaluation center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2025).

In this screenshot you can see me c  reating a new Windows Server 2025 virtual machine in VirtualBox, selecting the installation ISO and configuring the OS edition

### Set Up Fullscreen
When you first set up your VM with VirtualBox it's going to be shown in a small square frame instead of fullscreen like we're used to. This isn't an issue as all we need to do is check a setting withing the application then download an application inside the Windows Server.

After downloading VBoxWindowsAdditions restart your VM and you should be able to toggle the option into full screen mode.
